# Password Compiler

**Author:** alfanowski

## Description

The "Password Compiler" program is a Python application that generates possible passwords based on a person's name, surname, and date of birth. It intelligently combines these inputs, adding numbers and special characters to increase the complexity and security of the generated passwords.

## How it Works

The program prompts the user to input their name, surname, and date of birth. It utilizes this information to create a password by intelligently combining different components, and then adds numbers and special characters to enhance the password's security.
